Pour des raisons de sécurité, il n'est accessible qu'à partir du serveur d'API. etc. etcd permet de notifier au cluster les changements de configuration à l'aide de surveillants. Les notifications sont des requêtes API sur chaque nœud du cluster etcd pour déclencher la mise à jour des informations dans le stockage du nœud.\n\n\nkube-apiserver:\n\n\nLe serveur API Kubernetes est l'entité de gestion centrale qui reçoit toutes les demandes REST de modifications (aux pods, services, ensembles de réplication/contrôleurs et autres), servant de front-end au cluster. C'est également le seul composant qui communique avec le cluster etcd, s'assurant que les données sont stockées dans etcd et sont en accord avec les détails des services des pods déployés.\n\n\nkube-controller-manager:\n\n\nExécute un certain nombre de processus de contrôle distincts en arrière-plan (par exemple, le contrôleur de réplication contrôle le nombre de replica dans un pod, le contrôleur de endpoints remplit les objets endpints comme les services et les pods) pour réguler l'état partagé du cluster et effectuer des tâches de routine. Lorsqu'un changement dans la configuration d'un service se produit (par exemple, le remplacement de l'image à partir de laquelle les pods sont exécutés, ou la modification des paramètres dans le fichier yaml de configuration), le contrôleur repère le changement et commence à travailler vers le nouvel état souhaité.\n\n\ncloud-controller-manager:\n\n\nLe responsable de la gestion des processus du contrôleur qui dépendent du cloud provider sous-jacent (le cas échéant). Par exemple, lorsqu'un contrôleur doit vérifier si un nœud a été résilié ou configurer des routes, des équilibreurs de charge ou des volumes dans l'infrastructure du cloud provider, tout cela est géré par le cloud provider.\n\n\nkube-scheduler:\n\n\nAide à planifier les pods (un groupe de conteneurs co-localisés à l'intérieur desquels nos processus d'application sont exécutés) sur les différents nœuds en fonction de l'utilisation des ressources. Il lit les exigences opérationnelles du service et le planifie sur le nœud le mieux adapté. Par exemple, si l'application a besoin de 1 Go de mémoire et de 2 cœurs CPU, les pods de cette application seront planifiés sur un nœud disposant au moins de ces ressources. Le planificateur s'exécute chaque fois qu'il est nécessaire de planifier des pods. Le planificateur doit connaître les ressources totales disponibles ainsi que les ressources allouées aux charges de travail existantes sur chaque nœud.\n\n","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/introducing-kubernetes-architecture/","title":"Introducing Kubernetes Architecture"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-basics/":{"body":"Kubernetes basics\nTesting first cluster: Show cluster info\ncontrolplane $ kubectl cluster-info\n\nKubernetes master is running at https://172.17.0.10:6443\nKubeDNS is running at https://172.17.0.10:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy\nDeploying in Kube\nComment on spawn un container dans Kube ?\nC'est décrire l'état final qu'on veut dans Kubernetes.\nKubernetes tentera de converger vers cet état lors de sa boucle de réconciliation.\nOn lui demande le nombre de replica que l'on souhaite poi=ur une même ressource.\n\n\n1st case: deploying in specific limited namespace\n\n\n2nd case: \n\n\nDeployment tools\n\n\nCD (PAAS over Kube)\n\n\nHelm\n\n\nHelmfile\n\n\n","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-basics/","title":"Kubernetes basics"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-installation/":{"body":"Installation with kubeadm\nCreate cluster from scratch with kubeadm\nInstallation on AWS via kops\nCluster install on AWS with KOPS\nClassic way cluster install on AWS with Turnkey\nKubernetes on openstack\nInstalling Kubernetes on OpenStack\nInstalling Kubernetes on OpenStack and Bare-metal\nInstalling Kubernetes on OpenStack and AWS the hard way\nAfter POC on AWS...\nThe hard way, Kops\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"\"\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"\"\nexport AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=\"\"\n\naws sts get-caller-identity\n\ncurl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '\"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64\n\nchmod +x kops-linux-amd64\n\nsudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops\n\naws route53 create-hosted-zone --name kolorado.e-monkeys.tech --caller-reference 10\n\ndig NS kolorado.e-monkeys.tech\n\naws s3 mb s3://kolorado.e-monkeys.tech\n\nexport KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://kolorado.e-monkeys.tech\n\nkops create cluster kolorado.e-monkeys.tech --cloud aws --zones us-east-2c\nkops get cluster\nkops edit cluster kolorado.e-monkeys.tech\nkops edit ig --name=kolorado.e-monkeys.tech nodes\nkops edit ig --name=kolorado.e-monkeys.tech master-us-east\nkops update cluster --name kolorado.e-monkeys.tech --yes --admin\nkops rolling-update cluster --cloudonly\n\n# get kubeconfig in s3://kolorado.e-monkeys.tech\nUsing cluster from kubectl context: kolorado.dev.e-monkeys.tech\n\nNAME                    STATUS  NEEDUPDATE      READY   MIN     TARGET  MAX\nmaster-us-east-2c       Ready   0               1       1       1       1\nnodes-us-east-2c        Ready   0               1       1       1       1\n\nkops validate cluster --wait 10m\n\nkubectl get nodes --show-labels\nDelete cluster with Kops\nkops delete cluster kolorado.e-monkeys.tech --yes\nThe easy/good K8s on AWS way, eksctl\nSpawning nodes mode of eksctl:\n\n\nFargate - Linux - Sélectionnez ce type de nœud si vous souhaitez exécuter des applications Linux sur AWS Fargate.

(controller-centric opinionated explanation)\nInitial release: 7 June 2014; 7 years ago\nAujourd'hui, en 2021, force est de constater que Kubernetes est devenu incontournable et la plupart des cloud providers proposent désormais des solutions Kubernetes hébergées.\nIl faudra attendre 2013 pour que Google lance sa première offre IAAS en ayant été ralenti par l'échec de son PAAS AppEngine.\nUn des enjeux de K8S fut de réussir a mixer la flexibilité du IAAS et la facilité d'accès, la descriptabilité du PAAS, ce que l'on pourrait appeler l'IPAAS (merci à @Guilhem pour ce terme).\nIl fallait donc un standrad pour l'orchestration, une API qui puisse gérer l'ensemble de ces caractéristiques.\nKubernetes est strictement impératif, je demande un état, je me fiche de connaître les étapes intermédiaires.\nPar exemple:\n\n\"J'aimerai un espace isolé dont les applications n'utilisent que 4Go de RAM et 2 CPU\"\n\"J'aimerai une base de données répliquée 2 fois\"\n\"J'aimerai un storage avec une rétention de 6 mois\"\n\"J'aimerai que des mises a jour soit déployées mais n'impactent que les applications du ns 'web' ou correspondant au tag 'web'\"\n\nTerminologie\nKubernetes est un système d’orchestration qui permet de déployer et de gérer des conteneurs. Les conteneurs ne sont pas gérés individuellement. Au lieu de cela ils font partie d’un ensemble plus grand appelé Pod.\nUn Pod se compose d’un ou de plusieurs conteneurs qui partagent une adresse IP, un accès au stockage et un espace de nommage.\nL’orchestration est gérée par des contrôleurs. Ces contrôleurs sont compilés dans le kube-controller-manager.\nUn service est une abstraction qui définit un ensemble logique de Pods.\nLe ReplicaSet est un contrôleur qui déploie et redémarre les pods. Le ReplicaSet démarre ou arrête des conteneurs. Il est la pour vérifier que le bon nombre de conteneurs est actif.\nIl y a aussi des Jobs and CronJobs pour s’occuper de tâches uniques ou récurrentes.\nGérer facilement des milliers de Pods sur des centaines de nœuds peut s’avérer difficile. \nPour faciliter la gestion il faut utiliser des labels. Les labels sont des chaînes arbitraires qui font partie des métadonnées de l’objet. Les labels peuvent être utilisés pour changer l’état des objets sans avoir à en connaître les noms individuels ou les UIDs.\nLe state\nOn va distinguer la notion de spec de la notion de statut.\nS'il réussi a converger à l'issue de sa boucle de réconciliation, l'état est appliqué et le résultat retourné à l'api server.\nIl était très compliqué d'atteindre l'indempotence avec Puppet ou Chef par exemple, car outre l'effet snowflake, certains composants tel le réseau on-premise, n'étaient pas prévus pour être indompotents.\nDeux machines, 2 versions ne vont pas nécessairement réagir de la même façon. C'est l'effet snowflake car tous les flocons se ressemblent et il devient presque impossible distinguer/troubleshooter les différences sur des milliers de machines de production.\nKubernetes répond a ce problème car il maintient l'état et le retourne après action. On a donc un avant et un après.\nLes pratiques de Kube sont basées sur Google mais également sur beaucoup d'autres suggestions de la communauté.\nL'organe de certification de la CNCF permet d'assurer que toutes les solutions qui sont vendues sont compatibles.\nOn a un cluster ETCD qui sert a la persistence de l'état. \nL'API server est en somme un \"gardien du temple\" qui s'assure de la validité des requêtes émises.\nUne certaine approche des problèmes\nA quoi sert d'avoir plusieurs clusters quand on pourrait tout mutualiser sur un cluster/context/tenant ?\nParce que cette centralisation ne permet pas une bonne organisation ni d'être scalable simplement ni de patcher efficacement.\nCela entraînera nécessairement des contraintes sécuritaiers de type enforcement des pod security rules, non-root user ou encore priviledged escalation files par exemple.\nOn aura donc moins de latitude sur un unique cluster car tout le monde a un besoin différent donc c'est la règle de la contrainte la plus forte va s'appliquer a tous.\n","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-kesako/","title":"Kubernetes, Kesako ?"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-tools/":{"body":"Kubernetes Client Tools\nKrew: plugin manager for Kubernetes\n(\n  set -x; cd \"$(mktemp -d)\" &amp;&amp;\n  OS=\"$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\" &amp;&amp;\n  ARCH=\"$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\\(arm\\)\\(64\\)\\?.*/\\1\\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')\" &amp;&amp;\n  KREW=\"krew-${OS}_${ARCH}\" &amp;&amp;\n  curl -fsSLO \"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/latest/download/${KREW}.tar.gz\" &amp;&amp;\n  tar zxvf \"${KREW}.tar.gz\" &amp;&amp;\n  ./\"${KREW}\" install krew\n)\n\necho \"export PATH='${KREW_ROOT:-$HOME/.krew}/bin:$PATH'\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nKubectx + Kubens\nkubectl krew install ctx\nkubectl krew install ns\nHelm\ncurl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3\nchmod 700 get_helm.sh\n./get_helm.sh\nHelm on Windows\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\nchoco install kubernetes-helm\nKubie\nK9s\n","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/kubernetes-tools/","title":"Kubernetes Tooling"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/sts/":{"body":"Stateful applications in EKS\nhttps://www.nebulaworks.com/insights/posts/leveraging-aws-ebs-for-kubernetes-persistent-volumes/\nOne such type of persistent volume is the AWSElasticBlockStore which is the type this blog will focus on.\nSteps\naws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone=eu-west-1a --size=10 --volume-type=gp2\n\naws ec2 attach-volume --device /dev/xvdf --instance-id &lt;MASTER NODE ID&gt; --volume-id &lt;YOUR VOLUME ID&gt;\n\nsudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/&lt;NAME OF VOLUME FROM PREV STEP&gt;\n\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/application/mysql/mysql-deployment.yaml\n\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/application/mysql/mysql-pv.yaml\n\nkubectl describe deployment mysql\n\nkubectl run -it --rm --image=mysql:5.6 --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h mysql -ppassword\n\nkubectl delete deployment,svc mysql\nkubectl delete pvc mysql-pv-claim\nkubectl delete pv mysql-pv-volume\n","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/blog/sts/","title":"Stateful K8s applications"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/docs/":{"body":"","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/docs/","title":"Docs"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/docs/getting-started/":{"body":"","id":"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},"https://masterclassk8s.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":"Quick Start\nOne page summary of how to start a new AdiDoks project.
